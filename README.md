The MediaPipe hands API for python has been modified so we can extract the land marks and save them to a csv file.

The data is used in TensorFlow to train an MLP with it.

The MLP is integrated with MediaPipe.

All codes that are added to the MediaPipe base code have a #marked comment in front of them.
